# Introduction
You will need Java 1.8.x or higher and Maven 3 or higher installed. You should be able to do a "java -version" and "mvn -version" from command line.

cd to the rxdemo-server subdirectory and perform a "mvn clean install" operation.
cd to the rxdemo-server/rest subdirectory and perform a "mvn exec:java".
At this point the server should be running and listening on port 8839. You can confirm this by hitting the httpget call for drugs to prescribe: localhost:4567/drugs.

You may alternatively run the application from within your IDE if it has processed maven 3 dependencies. The main class to run is in the rest sub-module, AppMainRunner.java.

Unit tests for server-side logic are in fdkesk-server/core/src/test/java. They may be executed by a "mvn test" operation from rxdemo-server directory, or from within IDE.

You must be in Gloomhaven (not at a scenario). Go to the character page. Click Gold > Sanctuary Donation...
